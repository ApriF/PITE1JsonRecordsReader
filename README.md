I/ OBJECTIVE

The projectâ€™s goal is to simulate a small-scale data processing pipeline that:
    - Reads structured JSON data (records)
    - Filters the data based on configurable conditions
    - Computes simple statistics (count, sum, average)
    -  Prints clean, timestamped summaries

It aims to follow enterprise-grade practices:
    - Modular and testable code (core.py and io.py)
    - Configuration via config.json
    - CLI-ready and automation-friendly
    - CI/CD-compatible testing using pytest


The program:

1. Reads a JSON file containing records such as
{ "status": "ok", "value": 42 }

2. Filters out only the entries where status equals "ok" (case-insensitive)
and the numeric value is greater than or equal to a threshold

3. Computes:
    - The number of valid records (count)
    - The total of all valid values (sum)
    - Their average (avg)
4. Prints a formatted summary in the console.

Output example : ok=38 total_value=1714 avg=45.11

II/ TESTS RUN

I had a lot of trouble to run the tests because pytest could not recognize my src folder and I still don't understand clearly why. 
So I found out that it was good to create a virtual environment with these commands (on Windows):

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -U pip pytest
python -m pytest -v


III/ RUN THE PROJECT MANUALLY

1. Choose and load the file you want to analyse and the threshold value and enter threshold value in the config.json file
2. Run in the terminal 
python -m src.io
3. Output example:  ok=35 total_value=1472 avg=42.06


My sample_100.json file has been generated by data_generator.py

IV/ EXAMPLE


input : 
[
  {"status": "ok", "value": 45.5},
  {"status": "bad", "value": 23},
  {"status": "OK", "value": "18"},
  {"status": "error", "value": null}
]

Only records where status is "ok" (case-insensitive) and value is numeric and greater than or equal to the thresholdare kept for analysis.
